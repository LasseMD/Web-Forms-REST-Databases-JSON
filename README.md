# Script Programming Lab: Web Forms, REST, Databases, and JSON

This repository showcases solutions for the Script Programming tasks, which revolve around creating web forms, handling REST services, interacting with databases, and managing JSON data using Python and Flask framework.

## Accomplishments

### Handling Web Forms

- **Web Form Creation**: Developed an interactive web form using HTML5 attributes to capture user input for email, password, and numeric fields.
- **Form Handling**: Implemented a Python script (`form_handler.py`) to process form submissions and display registered information in a user-friendly format on a web page.

### Flask, JSON, and Databases

- **Simulated Weather Station Data**: Created a Python script (`weather_station_simulator.py`) to simulate a weather station transmitting meteorological data in JSON format.
- **Database Integration**: Developed a Python script (`weather_data_handler.py`) to parse JSON data and insert it into a SQLite database for storage.
- **Web Page Display**: Built a Flask application (`app.py`) to retrieve weather station data from the SQLite database and display it on a web page, providing users with a convenient way to access and visualize the data.
